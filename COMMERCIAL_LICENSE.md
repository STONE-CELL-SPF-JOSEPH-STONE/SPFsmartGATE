## The SPF Complexity Formula

The SPF Complexity Formula and its implementation are
proprietary intellectual property of Joseph Stone. The formula
includes but is not limited to:

- C = basic^1 + deps^7 + complex^10 + files * 10
- a_optimal(C) = W_eff * (1 - 1 / ln(C + e))
- All associated tier calculations, weight systems, and
  dynamic complexity factors

Commercial use of the formula, its implementation, or
derivative works based on the formula requires a commercial
license.

## Commercial License Terms

Commercial licenses are granted under the following terms:

- **Per-organization** -- One license covers all employees
  and contractors within a single legal entity.
- **Perpetual for version purchased** -- The license is
  perpetual for the specific version of SPFsmartGATE licensed.
  Access to future versions requires license renewal or
  upgrade.
- **Non-transferable** -- Licenses may not be transferred,
  sublicensed, or assigned to another organization without
  written consent from the licensor.
- **No redistribution** -- Commercial licenses do not grant
  the right to redistribute SPFsmartGATE source code. OEM
  and redistribution rights require a separate agreement.
